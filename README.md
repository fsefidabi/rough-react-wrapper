This is a React wrapper for [Rough.js](https://roughjs.com/), a JavaScript library for creating sketchy, hand-drawn graphics.

[rough-react-wrapper](https://github.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper) is an alternative for the archived [react-rough](https://github.com/ooade/react-rough) package published by [ooade](https://github.com/ooade).
The mentioned package has been archived by its owner, and we needed same react wrapper for rough.js drawable objects.
So, I decided to publish another version of this wrapper with more feature supports.

> ðŸŸ¢ If you are already using the archived [react-rough](https://github.com/ooade/react-rough) package in your projects, you can simply install this new [rough-react-wrapper](https://github.com/fsefidabi/roughjs-react) package,
> and your code will work like a charm! The API is exactly similar, but with some more feature supports: 
> - React 18 support
> - NextJs app router and server side components support


## Installation

You can add rough-react-wrapper to your project via npm.

```
npm install rough-react-wrapper
```


## Usage

To render a rectangle svg in sketchy and hand-drawn style, add these lines into your React component:
```js
import ReactRough, { Rectangle } from 'rough-react-wrapper'

return (
    <ReactRough
        renderer={"svg"}
        width={250}
        height={250}
    >
      <Rectangle
          width={200}
          height={200}
          x={10}
          y={10}
          fill="#6700c9"
          fillStyle={"cross-hatch"}
      />
  </ReactRough>
)
```

It will generate a rectangle shape like this:

## Props

| name                      | type                                                             | default                                 | description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

A rectangle with the roughness of 0 would be a perfect rectangle. There is no upper limit to this value, but a value over 10 is mostly useless.                                                                                                                     |
| bowing                    | `number`                                                         | `1`                                     | Indicates how curvy the lines are when drawing a sketch.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| seed                      | `number`                                                         | `0`                                     | Sets the seed for creating random values used in shape generation. This is useful for creating the exact shape when re-generating with the same parameters. The value of seed is between 1 and 2^31. If seed is not defined, or set to 0, no seed is used when computing random values.                 |
| stroke                    | `string`                                                         | `black`                                 | Represents the color used to paint the outline of the drawn objects. If this is set to `none`, the shape vectors do not contain a stroke (This is different from having a transparent stroke).                                                                                                          |

In `hachure` style fills, this represents the color of the hachure lines. In `dots` style, it represents the color of the dots.                                                                                                                              |

A value of 1 will ensure that the dimensions are almost 100% accurate.                                                                                       |

| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `hachure`      | Draws sketchy parallel lines with the same roughness as defined by the roughness and the bowing properties of the shape. It can be further configured using the `fillWeight`, `hachureAngle`, and `hachureGap` properties.       | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-hachure.png" alt="fill-style-hachure" width="50">            |
| `solid`        | Like a conventional fill                                                                                                                                                                                                         | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-solid.png" alt="fill-style-solid" width="50">                |
| `zigzag`       | Draws zig-zag lines filling the shape                                                                                                                                                                                            | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-zigzag.png" alt="fill-style-zigzag" width="50">              |
| `cross-hatch`  | Similar to `hachure`, but draws cross hatch lines (akin to two `hachure` fills 90 degrees from each other).                                                                                                                      | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-cross-hatch.png" alt="fill-style-cross-hatch" width="50">    |
| `dots`         | Fills the shape with sketchy dots.                                                                                                                                                                                               | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-dots.png" alt="fill-style-dots" width="50">                  |
| `dashed`       | Similar to `hachure` but the individual lines are dashed. Dashes can be configured using the `dashOffset` and `dashGap` properties.                                                                                              | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-dashed.png" alt="fill-style-dashed" width="50">              |
| `zigzag-line`  | Similar to `hachure` but individual lines are drawn in a zig-zag fashion. The size of the zig-zag can be configured using the `zigzagOffset` proeprty.                                                                           | <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fsefidabi/rough-react-wrapper/master/assets/fill-style-zigzag-line.png" alt="fill-style-zigzag-line" width="50">    |
